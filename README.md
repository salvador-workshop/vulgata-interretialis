# VULGATA INTERRETIALIS

> Vulgate of the Web

## Purpose and Goals

This project aims to produce a version of the Latin Vulgate Bible which:

1. is native to the web
1. is presented beautifully, both in typography and visuals
1. is a useful study aid for Catholic dorks like myself, or anyone else

More specifically, the Vulgata Interretialis aims to:

1. be a polyglot bible in two columns, Latin on left, and English (_Douay-Rheims_) on right
1. be available in two versions:
    - WEB / APP / EPUB -- seamless, like reading a scroll
    - PDF -- set into pages
1. use fully accented (_Italianate Ecclesial Latin style, not Classical_) text, for ease of use
1. look like a classic bible in appearance, with black text and red for rubrics, highlights, and artistic flair
1. leverage modern tech by making the Word easily navigable on screens

## The Clementine Vulgate Project (VulSearch)

Big shout out to Michael Tweedale et al. for their work on The Clementine Vulgate Project. In many ways, I've just dressed up the texts they've produced.
